[12:29:38] USER: Question.

[12:29:39] ASSISTANT: Okay, I'm in Q&A mode. Ask away!


[12:30:14] USER: Why is the sky red?

[12:30:14] ASSISTANT: The sky appears red during sunrise and sunset because the sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere. This scatters away most of the blue light, leaving mostly red light to reach our eyes.


[12:30:54] USER: Thank you. That's all for now.

[12:34:14] USER: That's the CEO supervisor. You grew up on this show, you became a wife and a mom. Since this show, who would you say has changed the most since becoming a mom? They say you lose sleep. You do <laugh>. There is nothing like losing sleep. I mean, it's truly you wake up and you're like, what time is it? Uh, but anything she needs, I'm there for what if.

[12:36:00] USER: I don't responded this a bit after. It's kind of like too late for me to say anything about it. But where my mind was at at the time, I was like, sure, there's a lot of variants that goes into basically who were interviewer is. And just a lot of various things. Like, for example, for my TikTok phone round, I AC instantly came easily, easily thought. Well, but honestly, the dude just like. Mean to me. And I just don't think he liked me at a certain point. I started to, to ask myself, like, can I really beat this unlucky? There's no way I get this unlucky and get this short straw, like every single time, plus I'm not gonna talk it up to luck or when whatever. The point of this is that. I get where I am without any, without. Any, um, luck involved in just like pure, um, hard work, pure determination, like people say luck is a skill. Um, so you want to give yourself as many chances as possible in order to get lucky that one time or to. You know, counteract the times when you do get unlucky. So yeah, instead of saying, you know what, I just got lucky, I'm gonna be saying. What did I do wrong and how can I improve on it in the future? I know and responded this a bit after it's kind of like. Too late for me to say anything about it, but it where my mind was at, at the top. I had, I used to don't tell me this is a half Cambodian.

[12:36:12] USER: How, what the fuck are you doing, man? Oh, let's go. Excuse me, she's bleeding and turn tonight. I'm at.
