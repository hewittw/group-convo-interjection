Like, for example, for my TikTok phone round, I AC instantly came easily, easily thought. Well, but honestly, the dude just like. Mean to me. And I just don't think he liked me at a certain point. I started to, to ask myself, like, can I really beat this unlucky? There's no way I get this unlucky and get this short straw, like every single time, plus I'm not gonna talk it up to luck or when whatever. The point of this is that.
