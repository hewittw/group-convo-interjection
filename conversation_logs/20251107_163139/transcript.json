Um, and so now we can just talk and go back and forth and it it's pretty darn good. Um, yeah, I accidentally left it going when I was. On like Instagram reels before and like transcribed every single reel. It was creepy. I need to make sure that doesn't go in the GitHub. <laugh> um, <laugh>. But no, it works great.
